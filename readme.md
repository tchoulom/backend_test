# Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- GitHub account and client
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman
- MongoDB (optional)

# Tasks

1. Fork the project into your own GitHub account (it should be kept public)

1. Install the project from your own fork and set it to run on port 3000

1. Fix `GET /items` route so that it properly returns the list of all existing items

1. Add the ability to filter the items in the `GET /items` route (propose a solution that complies with the best practices of a REST API):

   - `GET /items?filter_by=active` should return all the _active_ items
   - `GET /items?filter_by=inactive` should return all the _inactive_ items

1. Identify some basic security and stability issues, and document simple ways of correcting them (implementation is not required but is considered a bonus)

1. Create a new 'mongodb' branch of the project on GitHub: with the aim of connecting the application to a MongoDB database, which script(s) should be adapted? Propose a draft code along these lines (a fully functional implementation is not required but is considered a bonus ; the provision of a data set will be appreciated)

1. Referring to this [tutorial](https://welovedevs.com/fr/articles/postman/), add a Postman project (collections, variable if necessary) for simple testing of the API

# Notes

- Don't forget to comment your code and to commit it to GitHub _at each step_ in order to properly keep track of the changes you made (and why you made them)
- Please document any additional steps and operations required by changes and additions to the project in a separate `.md` document
